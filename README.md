# Students-Mental-Health-Analysis

As we know it, more attention is being paid to mental health in the last few years, and this brought about the need for m to carry out an analysis on the mental health of students. 
The data was gotten from Kaggle, and there are 11 columns and 102 rows.

Microsoft SQL Servr was used to query the Database, and Visualizations were done using Power BI.
